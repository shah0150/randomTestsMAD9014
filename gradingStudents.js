// Case: Grading Students

// You are a teacher, and you want to calculate and grade your students' test scores. You want to teach your students how to use JavaScript to determine their grades based on their scores.

// Here are the grading criteria:

// A score of 90 or above is an 'A.'
// A score between 80 and 89 is a 'B.'
// A score between 70 and 79 is a 'C.'
// A score between 60 and 69 is a 'D.'
// Any score below 60 is an 'F.'

// Your task is to write a JavaScript program that takes a student's score and calculates their grade. Additionally, you want to create a loop to calculate grades for multiple students.
